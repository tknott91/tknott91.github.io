				<h1>JB and the jackdaws</h1>
				<p><i>In which I discover that JB Priestley was sometime patron of an Austrian naturalist and saviour of jackdaws.</i></p>

				<p>As I often do when on holiday, I was flicking through the books; a collection of second-hand volumes that filled a shelf in the cottage in which I was staying, on Tresco, Isles of Scilly.</p>
				<p>I picked one I knew nothing about, with a nice title, King Solomon’s Ring, by one Konrad Lorenz, and started reading.</p>
				<p>The dedication caught my eye:</p>
				<p>To Mr and Mrs J. B. Priestley, without whose timely help jackdaws would not—in all probability—be flying round Altenberg any more.</p>	
				<p>JB Priestley? The guy who wrote that play we all had to read for GCSE English?</p>	
				<p>Were the summers of the Bradford-born author of An Inspector Calls (and his second wife, Jane Wyndham-Lewis) passed saving the corvid populations of small Austrian villages?</p>	
				<p>Were others at it? Would I discover that Philip Larkin had been covertly funding the conservation of the long-wattled umbrellabird?</p>	
				<p>It begged investigation.</p>	
				<p>Konrad Lorenz was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian zoologist, active from around 1933 to his death in 1989. One of the fathers of modern ethology—the study of animal behaviour—he was best known for his work on “imprinting”, the process by which some newborn critters instinctively bond with the first moving object they see. His 1949 book, King Solomon’s Ring, named for the magic ring with which Solomon was said to be able to talk with all creatures great and small, is his own account of trying to commune with animal-kind.</p>	
				<p>A year before it was published, however, things were not all wine and roses for Lorenz.</p>	
				<p>In February 1948, having served as a psychologist in the German army before spending nearly four years as a Russian prisoner of war, Lorenz returned to his home in Altenberg, a village on the banks of the Danube, just outside Vienna.</p>	
				<p>He had been treated well by the Russians. Under their care, he was able to write the first draft of a book on comparative animal behaviour, which the Soviet authorities, after some persuading that it contained nothing but “unpolitical science”, allowed him to take home, along with a starling he befriended while imprisoned.</p>	
				<p>But, upon his return, he was out of a job, with no promise of an academic chair becoming vacant, and of little means; his wife had been successfully running a small farm in his absence, which kept food on the table for them and their children, but no money. Yet his ambition was undamped.</p>	
				<p>He would strike out on his own, contemplating a research institute of his own. He needed funding. And fast.</p>	
				<p>Ever since his youth, when his parents tolerated his inordinate fascination with animals, Lorenz had been collecting—everything from fish to dogs to a capuchin monkey called Gloria. But this ballooning menagerie was catching up with him.</p>	
				<p>He wrote to a friend of his, William Homan Thorpe, a British ornithologist: “The jackdaws are really very expensive because of the damage they do to the roof and eaves...If I were a hard hearted scientist I should do away with the jackdaws but they are so much a symbol of Altenberg, being the only birds who lived through the war, that I simply cannot do it.”</p>	
				<p>Luckily for Lorenz, and his jackdaws, Thorpe heard from fellow birder Edward Max Nicholson, that the author JB Priestley had royalty money tied up in Austria which couldn’t be used elsewhere. (As a side note, Nicholson would go on to found the World Wildlife Fund.)</p>	
				<p>Thorpe immediately wrote to Priestley’s wife, describing Lorenz’s predicament.</p>	
				<p>And just before Christmas of 1948, the Priestleys came through: Lorenz received 3,770 Austrian shillings from the author and his wife via the Austrian Academy of Sciences, with the promise of more to come.</p>	
				<p>He proceeded to turn his own home into a small research station, given the rather grand mouthful: Institut für Vergleichende Verhaltensforschung unter der Leitung der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (“Institute for Comparative Behaviour Study, under the Direction of the Austrian Academy of Sciences”).</p>
				<p>So Lorenz, thanks to Priestley’s ring-fenced royalties, could finally buy coke enough to heat his study and repair the roof, allowing the jackdaws to live on in the eaves of Altenberg and the dedication of King Solomon’s Ring.</p>
