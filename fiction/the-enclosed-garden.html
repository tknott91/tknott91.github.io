        <p>The craft crept through the black water, the men clustered white and wary as teeth biting into lead-shot game.</p>
        <p>All but one. Gabriel, upright in a cassock that clung heavy to his frame, fingering the cross at his breast.</p>
        <p>Lips moving in prayer, he heard the men’s mutterings. Why a man sought not gold, but bones, in this God-forsaken place. Said they’d take ​his​ home if they didn’t find the saint’s soon. He had lied, of course. The bones were no saint’s. Though, in his eyes...</p>
        <p>He remembered the dear cool hush of the cloister, disturbed only by the brother who stalked him in the walkway. The brother with whom he had tended the enclosed garden, hands clasped together beneath the red anemones, sharing prayers, cell, and cot. The brother he had betrayed by confessing their sin to a father who vowed to remove such temptation. The brother sent on mission before his time.</p>
        <p>Gabriel was brought back by the native, who thrust pouted lips at the bank. Here.</p>
        <p>The raft beached, he led Gabriel to a clearing. There, in a patch of light, the remains lay. Gabriel’s feet faltered. But soon his hands were on rags, home to bones. Not the veneration you deserve. He lifted the skull to his lips, and a line came unbidden: And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
        <p>Borne back down the river by eager oars, Gabriel clasped the bundle. Home now, beautiful boy. Then he saw him, amongst the trees. Gabriel’s hands tightened about the tatters, and closed on something in its folds. A note. He looked back, to see only the nodding wet leaves. On old skin were fresh words in his own tongue. He read, tears bleeding the ink black to green to drip on heathen bones.</p>
