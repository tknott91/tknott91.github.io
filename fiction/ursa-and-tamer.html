        <p>A ball! Such a change from the drab villages we’d been playing for months. Tamer, my Tamer, would grind out dregs of songs from his organ, while I swayed on my hind legs, children throwing coins at my muddy feet, shrieking and recoiling to retreat behind their mothers’ skirts. But now we were off to a ball! Just think of it.</p>
        <p>As we trundled to the Duke’s estate, I fussed with my new collar. It was a delicate, lovely thing, the height of fashion so Tamer said, though I wished it didn’t bite so. And, oh, for a new coat! Tamer had licked me into shape as best he could by the stream, brushing my matted and flea-bit fur, whispering in my ear as he did so: Ursa, you keep your mouth closed and your paws to yourself and we’ll have ourselves a feast. He looked into my eyes as he stroked my neck, and smiled. I knew better than to smile back.</p>
        <p>We arrived to much ado. Oblivious to the claps and gasps, my gaze was tugged by the painted ballroom ceiling, all forested idylls alive with wild animals. Even Tamer forgot himself, tearing away a face of open-mouthed awe to bow to our hosts.</p>
        <p>His musical accompaniment not needed tonight, he shambled about the grand room, leaving me on the dais to dance to unfamiliar tunes. He seemed lost as he chafed at his foreign garb, fingering his collar and pulling at his waistcoat, now and then turning to smile at me.</p>
        <p>At the end of one dance, a young man in furs leant on the stage-edge and looked me up and down with a cold, appraising eye. He whispered something to his lady companion before she glided away, offering her hand to my Tamer for the next dance—how red his face went!</p>
        <p>As Tamer and the lady processed in slow twirls about the room and the music swelled, armed men untethered me from the stage while the young man in furs looked on. My protests, choked to a low growl by a muzzle, and with limbs numb from dancing, went ignored.</p>
        <p>As the men dragged me away—mind the pelt!—I saw Tamer still beguiled in the arms of the lady; no eyes for me now. I looked up to the painted ceiling and danced no more.</p>
